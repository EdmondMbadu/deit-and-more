# deit -and-more

In this project we analyze the performance of the CAIT model on random images.
We utilize the deit model from the https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit/blob/main/README_cait.md repository because the model trained locally is >100.00 MB .
To run the model, first install the timm library using the following command: 
pip install timm==0.3.2. 
Then,  just run the execute.py. You can substitute the url used with any other that has an image attached to it. 

Some other things.
The model was trained using ImageNet 2012. 
This model has a 1000 classes.
